create a new repository on github
git remote add origin https://github.com/ditijain16/project.git,   this command is used if you dont have any repository in your system
git push -u origin main,  this command is used for when you have a repository and you want to create a repo in github
git init is used to scan the particular repo - pdf, word,etc
git add filename or git add .    | -  will add all the files
git commit -m "message"  
git branch -M main , this is used for when different people working on different branches, parts of the project

Steps  (execute separately) :
go the folder you have project in --> right click and choose Open with --> git bash here
type ls and it will show all the files
git init  - it will initialize the repository
git add . - it will add all the files in the repository
git commit -m "initial comment" - this will add the message
git remote add origin https://github.com/ditijain16/project.git - use this command to create a remote repo named origin, it will push the local repo to the link
git push -u origin master - if you do this for the first time then it will ask for authentication, otherwise it will push the latest commits made to the local repo to the remote repo
after this go to the link and check the commited files are availabe there
create a new file and save in the same folder
in git bash give git status (the file with red color is not added)


to add the new file :
git add .
 git commit -m "file added"
